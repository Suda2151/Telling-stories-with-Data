# About Me
Hello! I am Ananya Ghosh from India. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Information Systems Management with concentration on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I have worked as a software developer at SAP Labs for almost 3 years. I love to travel and meet new people. My career aspirations are to work as a Data Analyst or Data Engineer in a company which addresses social issues and make people's lives smoother and simpler.

# What I hope to learn
I believe that the job that I am aspiring for will need me to make lots of presentations. I want to learn to make boring data look appealing. Addressing people from different background is not easy and to make my idea sound convincing is even more difficult. I hope that the tools which I will be learning in this course will make my presentations appeal to the general public and help me get across my point easily.
