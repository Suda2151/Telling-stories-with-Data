# About Me
Hello! I am Ananya Ghosh from India. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying Information Systems Management with concentration on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I have worked as a software developer at SAP Labs for almost 3 years. My work was primarily in the e-commerce domain. My career aspirations are to work as a Data Analyst or Data Engineer in a company that addresses social issues. 

My hobbies include travelling and discovering my hidden potential. I love to meet new people and listen to their stories.

# What I hope to learn
They say "A picture is worth a thousand words". Similarly when complex ideas are expressed in pictorial form, even the most inexperienced person can understand the context. I believe that there are many stories hidden in data which are waiting to be uncovered. I want to learn to find such stories and narrate them effectively using tools that I will learn in this class.
