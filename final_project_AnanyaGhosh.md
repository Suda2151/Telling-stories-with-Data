## Overview - Food Recommendation System

### Outline:

When I first came to Pittsburgh, eating out was a nightmare. I had ample of apps to find out about the restaurants near me but my dining experience differed from that of the people who had reviewed the restaurants on those apps. As time passed, I befriended some Chinese friends. I noticed that they were using another app called Dazhondianping for finding out about restaurants. When I asked them why they didn't use Yelp or TripAdvisor, they said they didn't like the restaurants that had high rating on Yelp and TripAdvisor. Moreover, restaurants that had low rating on Yelp and TripAdvisor had good rating on Dazhondingpian. This conflict of interest made me curious to find out about the food preferences of people from different ethnic groups.

I have selected four websites - Yelp, TripAdvisor, Zomato and Dazhongdingpian - whose customer base varies from American to Indian to Chinese.

I have collected the following data about restaurants in Pittsburgh by scraping those 4 websites:
Name: 	                        name of the restaurant
Address: 	                      street address
Area: 	                        neighbourhood
Phone: 	                        contact number
Price : 	                      price range $-$$$$
Category:  	                    Italian,American...
Yelp_rating: 	                  restaurant rating on Yelp (0-5)
Yelp_number_of_reviews:	        number of reviews received on Yelp
Yelp_review: 	                  customer’s comments on food experience on Yelp
Zomato_rating: 	                restaurant rating on Zomato (0-5)
Zomato_number_of_reviews: 	    number of reviews received on Zomato
Zomato_review: 	                customer’s comments on food experience on Zomato
Tripadvisor_rating: 	          ratings from Tripadvisor
Tripadvisor_number_of_reviews: 	number of reviews received on Tripadvisor
Tripadvisor_review: 	          customer’s comments on food experience onTripadvisor
Dazhongdianping_rating: 	      restaurant rating on Dazhongdianping

* Correlations:<br>
    I will compare the ratings from different websites on the following parameters:<br>
        - Rating of Chinese food <br>
        - Rating of Indian food <br>
        - Rating of American / Mexican food <br>
        - Rating of restaurants serving Ethiopian food, Italian food or some cuisine other than American, Chinese and Indian<br>

At the end of this project, I am hopeful I will be able to find out about the taste and preferences of different ethnic groups and how they are differet from each other. I will also be able to create awareness that people from different places have differernt tastes, so next time someone is out with an international crowd, maybe they'd like to think more deeply about the food choices!


Here are few of the visualizations which I aim to establish:
