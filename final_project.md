## Project Outline
Finding a restaurant that suits your taste bud is a daunting task, especially when you have too many options to choose from. Restaurant finder apps do come to the rescue but do they really serve their purpose towards foreign students?
I met a lot of Chinese friends here at Heinz college. One problem that I found common to most of them was that they don't trust reviews given on Yelp and TripAdvisor. They found that those two websites do not really give reviews that align with their taste buds. Instead, they rely on Chinese version of Yelp called Dazhongdianping. 
In this project I have investigated further into this difference in taste and preference. I collected information about all the restaurants in Pittsburgh and observed how ratings differed for different ethnic groups. I chose 4 websites - Yelp, TripAdvisor, Zomato and Dazhongdianping for this purpose.

'A high-level summary of your project.  (Part I)
Collecting restaurant information was a challenging task. I scraped data from 4 websites and drew some conclusions from them. I chose these four websites with an assumption that ratings given on Yelp and TripAdvisor reflect the likings of Americans, the ratings on Zomato reflect those of Indians while the ratings on Dazhongdianping reflect those of Chinese.
I found out what are the top cuisine categories across the 3 ethnic groups. I took first 4 most popular category and used boxplots to show how the ratings varied across different ethnic groups.

A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story. (Part I)
Project consists of three main elements.
First is my experience at a dinner with my Chinese friends and the findings at that dinner that led me to choose this topic
Second. How I used the data collected from different websites to arrive at my final conclusion.
Third. Spread awareness among my classmate that poeple can have different preferences when it comes to food. Be understanding and try to be sensitive towards people's likes and dislikes. Afterall good food is an integral part of good relationship!

A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. (Part I)
Data collection was a tedious task. I collected data through web scraping. I used various libraries of Python to scrape through 4 websites. I faced a number of challenges in this process. Data collected from Chinese website was written in Chinese langu
A link to the publicly-accessible data you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. (Part I)
A few paragraphs summarizing your approach to the project (method and medium - Part I)

Final data story

A few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience for your final data story.  Include any personas and / or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

A few paragraphs that summarize the work you've done so far.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)
Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)
Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet here (Links to an external site.).  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.  (Part III)
Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.
